## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
 Ans:-
  	Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans:-
 	There is no declaration of a variable, just an assignment statement.

Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn’t know about the type of the variable until
the code is run. So declaration is of no use. It stores that value at some 
memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the 
contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not 
matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans:-
                   Advantage  	                  disadvantage
easy to learn, read and write	Slow speed
Improved productivity	Not memory efficient
Interpreted language	Weak in mobile computing
Dynamically typed	Database access
Vast libraries support	Runtime error




Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:-
•	Data science
•	Web development
•	API
•	Machine learning/artificial intelligence
•	Data analytic
•	Game development
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans:-
Variables are containers for sorting data values.
Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans:-
	Get user input with Python using the input() function			
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans:-
	By default input() function takes the user's input in a string
Q8. What is type casting?
Ans:-
	Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users. In this article, we will see the various technique for typecasting.
There can be two types of Type Casting in Python –
Implicit Type Casting
Explicit Type Casting


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans:-
	YES, we can take more than one input from the user by using split () function.
x, y = input().split ()

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans:- 
        Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes
and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans:-
   Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans:-
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans:-
      You can display program data to the console in Python with print() .

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans:-
        Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans:-
     In Python programming, you can perform division in two ways. The first one is Float Division("/") and the second is Integer Division("//") or Floor Division.
Float Division("/"): Divides left hand operand by right hand operand.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
Ans:-
B = 'iNeuron'
print(B* 3)
O/P
``` iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: 
 num = int(input('The number:'))
if (num%2)==0:
 print("{0} is even ".format(num))
 
else:
 print("{0} is odd".format(num))

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans:
 The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans:
     A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program. Python has 3 key Conditional Statements are if statement. if-else statement.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: 
 If: The if keyword is used to create conditional statements (if statements), and allows you to execute a block of code only if a condition is True.
Elif: It provides a convenient way to check one possibility out of several alternatives. All indented blocks have the same indent level. else block is executed only if all other expressions are false.
Else:  In the if-else statement, we have two branches incase the statement is true or false. The if block is executed in case the expression is true. The else block is executed in case the expression is false.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: 
Age = int(input('The Age:'))
if (Age>=18):
 print("I can vote")
 else:
 print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans :
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
print(sum(numbers))

O/P:
1137


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans:
  a = int(input('the first numbers :'))
b = int(input('the second numbers :'))
c = int(input('the third numbers :'))

largest = 0
if a>b and a>c:
    largest = a
if b>a and b>c:
     largest =b
if c>a and c>b:
     largest =c
print(largest, " is tha largest number")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
